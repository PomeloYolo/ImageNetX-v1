# ImageNetX Image Dataset Collection Project

Welcome to the **ImageNetX Training Project**!  
We're building a free, open-source object detection model using YOLO.  
✨ But we need **your images** to make it better!

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Build a diverse and open image dataset
- Train YOLO models for various object classes
- Publish the models freely (Colab + GitHub + Hugging Face)

- **Topics**: Animals, Plants
- **Formats**: JPG, PNG
- **Recommended Size**: 640x480 or larger (any size accepted)
